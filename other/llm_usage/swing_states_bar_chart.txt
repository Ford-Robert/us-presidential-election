# States with no polling data
states_without_poll <- setdiff(all_states, states_with_poll)

#### Merge state_stats with Electoral Votes ####

# Merge state_stats with ev_votes using left_join to retain all states
state_evs <- ev_votes %>%
  left_join(state_stats, by = "state")

#### Define Model Formula ####
fixed_formula <- support ~ days_to_election + sample_size + transparency_score + pollscore + state

#### Build Bayesian Models for Trump and Harris ####

  stop("Trump model could not be built. Check your polling data.")
} else if (is.null(model_harris)) {
  stop("Harris model could not be built. Check your polling data.")
}

#### Generating Predictions ####

# Plot posterior predictive checks
pp_check(model_trump)
pp_check(model_harris)

# Summarize the models
summary(model_trump)
summary(model_harris)

#### Step 1: Group Polling Data and Calculate Means ####

# Function to calculate mean predictors for each candidate and state
calculate_mean_predictors <- function(poll_data_candidate) {
  mean_predictors <- poll_data_candidate %>%
    group_by(state) %>%
    summarize(
      mean_days_to_election = mean(days_to_election, na.rm = TRUE),
      mean_sample_size = mean(sample_size, na.rm = TRUE),
      mean_transparency_score = mean(transparency_score, na.rm = TRUE),
      mean_pollscore = mean(pollscore, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  return(mean_predictors)
}

# Calculate mean predictors for Trump and Harris
mean_predictors_trump <- calculate_mean_predictors(poll_data_trump)
mean_predictors_harris <- calculate_mean_predictors(poll_data_harris)

#### Step 2: Generate Newdata for Posterior Predictions ####

# Function to generate newdata with one row per state
generate_newdata_one_row <- function(mean_predictors) {
  newdata <- mean_predictors %>%
    mutate(
      days_to_election = mean_days_to_election,
      sample_size = mean_sample_size,
      transparency_score = mean_transparency_score,
      pollscore = mean_pollscore
    ) %>%
    select(days_to_election, sample_size, transparency_score, pollscore, state)
  
  return(newdata)
}

# Generate newdata for Trump and Harris with one row per state
newdata_trump <- generate_newdata_one_row(mean_predictors_trump)
newdata_harris <- generate_newdata_one_row(mean_predictors_harris)

#### Step 3: Draw Posterior Predictions ####

# Generate posterior predictions for Trump
posterior_trump <- posterior_predict(model_trump, newdata = newdata_trump, draws = 1000)

# Generate posterior predictions for Harris
posterior_harris <- posterior_predict(model_harris, newdata = newdata_harris, draws = 1000)

# Assign state names to columns
colnames(posterior_trump) <- newdata_trump$state
colnames(posterior_harris) <- newdata_harris$state

# Verify dimensions and column names
dim(posterior_trump)  # Should be 1000 simulations x number of states with polling data
dim(posterior_harris) # Should be 1000 simulations x number of states with polling data
print(colnames(posterior_trump))
print(colnames(posterior_harris))

#### Step 4: Prepare Predicted Support for All States ####

# Initialize matrices to store predicted support
num_simulations <- 1000
trump_support_matrix <- matrix(NA_real_, nrow = num_simulations, ncol = length(all_states))
harris_support_matrix <- matrix(NA_real_, nrow = num_simulations, ncol = length(all_states))
colnames(trump_support_matrix) <- all_states
colnames(harris_support_matrix) <- all_states

# Assign predictions for states with polling data
# Loop through each state with polling data and assign predictions
for (state in states_with_poll) {
  # For Trump
  if (state %in% colnames(posterior_trump)) {
    trump_support_matrix[, state] <- posterior_trump[, state]
  }
  
  # For Harris
  if (state %in% colnames(posterior_harris)) {
    harris_support_matrix[, state] <- posterior_harris[, state]
  }
}

# Assign historical averages for states without polling data
for (state in states_without_poll) {
  # Get historical averages
  avg_democrat <- state_evs$avg_democrat[state_evs$state == state]
  avg_republican <- state_evs$avg_republican[state_evs$state == state]
  
  # Assign the historical average support to all simulations
  trump_support_matrix[, state] <- avg_republican
  harris_support_matrix[, state] <- avg_democrat
}

#### Step 5: Simulate 1000 Elections ####

# Initialize vectors to store EV counts for each simulation
trump_ev_counts <- rep(0, num_simulations)
harris_ev_counts <- rep(0, num_simulations)

# Loop through each state to allocate EVs based on support
for (state in all_states) {
  ev <- state_evs$ev[state_evs$state == state]
  
  # Retrieve support vectors for the state across all simulations
  trump_support <- trump_support_matrix[, state]
  harris_support <- harris_support_matrix[, state]
  
  # Allocate EVs based on which candidate has higher support
  trump_wins_state <- trump_support > harris_support
  harris_wins_state <- harris_support > trump_support
  # In case of a tie, you could randomly assign the EV or split it
  # Here, we ignore ties or could implement a specific rule
  # For simplicity, ties result in no EV allocated
  
  # Update EV counts
  trump_ev_counts <- trump_ev_counts + ev * trump_wins_state
  harris_ev_counts <- harris_ev_counts + ev * harris_wins_state
}

#### Step 6: Summarize Simulation Results ####

# Calculate the number of wins for each candidate
trump_wins <- sum(trump_ev_counts > harris_ev_counts)
harris_wins <- sum(harris_ev_counts > trump_ev_counts)
tie <- sum(trump_ev_counts == harris_ev_counts)

# Calculate the percentage chance of victory
trump_win_percent <- (trump_wins / num_simulations) * 100
harris_win_percent <- (harris_wins / num_simulations) * 100
tie_percent <- (tie / num_simulations) * 100

# Print results
cat("Simulation Results out of", num_simulations, "Elections:\n")
cat("Trump wins in", trump_wins, "simulations (", round(trump_win_percent, 2), "%).\n", sep = " ")
cat("Harris wins in", harris_wins, "simulations (", round(harris_win_percent, 2), "%).\n", sep = " ")
cat("Tied elections in", tie, "simulations (", round(tie_percent, 2), "%).\n", sep = " ")

# Optionally, calculate the average Electoral Votes for each candidate
avg_trump_ev <- mean(trump_ev_counts)
avg_harris_ev <- mean(harris_ev_counts)

cat("Average Electoral Votes for Trump:", round(avg_trump_ev, 2), "\n")
cat("Average Electoral Votes for Harris:", round(avg_harris_ev, 2), "\n")

I have written this bayesian model to predict the outcome of the US election. I want you to add a bit of code that will track the outcome of the 1000 simulations in the seven swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin)  to create a table that shows the probability that each candidate has of winning these swing states. The two candidate should be the columns, and each state is a row

ChatGPT: Certainly! To track the outcomes of the 1000 simulations specifically in the seven swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin), you can add a new section to your existing script. This section will calculate the probability of each candidate winning each swing state based on the simulation results.Here's how you can implement this:Step 7: Track Swing States OutcomesrCopy code#### Step 7: Track Swing States Outcomes ####

# Define the seven swing states
swing_states <- c("Arizona", "Georgia", "Michigan", "Nevada", "North Carolina", "Pennsylvania", "Wisconsin")

# Initialize a data frame to store the probabilities
swing_probabilities <- data.frame(
  state = swing_states,
  Trump = NA_real_,
  Harris = NA_real_,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Loop through each swing state to calculate win probabilities
for (state in swing_states) {
  if (state %in% all_states) {
    # Retrieve the support vectors for the current state across all simulations
    trump_support <- trump_support_matrix[, state]
    harris_support <- harris_support_matrix[, state]
    
    # Calculate the number of simulations where Trump wins the state
    trump_wins <- sum(trump_support > harris_support, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    # Calculate the number of simulations where Harris wins the state
    harris_wins <- sum(harris_support > trump_support, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    # Calculate the probabilities as percentages
    trump_prob <- (trump_wins / num_simulations) * 100
    harris_prob <- (harris_wins / num_simulations) * 100
    
    # Assign the probabilities to the data frame
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Trump"] <- trump_prob
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Harris"] <- harris_prob
  } else {
    # If the state is not present in the data, assign NA
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Trump"] <- NA
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Harris"] <- NA
    warning(paste("State", state, "is not present in the dataset."))
  }
}

# Optionally, format the probabilities to two decimal places
swing_probabilities <- swing_probabilities %>%
  mutate(
    Trump = round(Trump, 2),
    Harris = round(Harris, 2)
  )

# Print the swing states probability table
print(swing_probabilities)

# Optionally, save the table to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting
write_csv(swing_probabilities, "swing_states_probabilities.csv")

Explanation of the Added Code:Define Swing States:We start by specifying the seven swing states in a vector swing_states.Initialize Probability Data Frame:A new data frame swing_probabilities is created to store the probabilities of each candidate winning each swing state. It has three columns: state, Trump, and Harris.Loop Through Each Swing State:For each state in swing_states, the code checks if the state exists in the all_states vector to ensure it's present in the dataset.It retrieves the support vectors (trump_support and harris_support) for the current state across all simulations.It calculates the number of simulations where Trump and Harris win the state by comparing their support levels.Probabilities are calculated by dividing the number of wins by the total number of simulations (num_simulations) and converting them to percentages.These probabilities are then assigned to the corresponding row in the swing_probabilities data frame.Handling Missing States:If a state from swing_states is not found in all_states, the code assigns NA to both candidates for that state and issues a warning.Formatting and Output:The probabilities are rounded to two decimal places for better readability.The resulting table is printed to the console.Optionally, the table is saved as a CSV file named "swing_states_probabilities.csv" for further analysis or reporting purposes.Example Output:After running the added code, you should see an output similar to the following (note that actual probabilities will depend on your simulation results):markdownCopy code         state Trump Harris
1      Arizona  55.30 44.70
2       Georgia 48.20 51.80
3      Michigan 52.10 47.90
4        Nevada 60.50 39.50
5 North Carolina 49.75 50.25
6  Pennsylvania 53.60 46.40
7     Wisconsin 50.00 50.00
Integration into Existing Script:Place the above code after the existing sections, preferably after Step 6: Summarize Simulation Results. This ensures that the support matrices (trump_support_matrix and harris_support_matrix) are already populated with simulation data required for calculating the swing states probabilities.Additional Considerations:Handling Ties:In the current implementation, ties (where trump_support == harris_support) result in no EV being allocated. If you want to handle ties differently (e.g., randomly assigning the EV or splitting it), you can modify the win condition accordingly.Visualization:For better insights, consider visualizing the swing states probabilities using a bar chart or similar plot. Here's a quick example using ggplot2:rCopy codelibrary(tidyr)

# Convert the data frame to long format for plotting
swing_long <- swing_probabilities %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Trump", "Harris"), names_to = "Candidate", values_to = "Probability")

# Create a bar plot
ggplot(swing_long, aes(x = state, y = Probability, fill = Candidate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Probability of Winning Swing States",
       x = "State",
       y = "Probability (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
Saving the Plot:You can save the plot to a file using ggsave:rCopy codeggsave("swing_states_probabilities_plot.png", width = 10, height = 6)
By adding this section, you'll be able to specifically monitor and report the probabilities of each candidate winning the critical swing states, providing more granular insights into the election simulations.

This section will calculate the probability of each candidate winning each swing state based on the simulation results.Here's how you can implement this:Step 7: Track Swing States OutcomesrCopy code#### Step 7: Track Swing States Outcomes ####

# Define the seven swing states
swing_states <- c("Arizona", "Georgia", "Michigan", "Nevada", "North Carolina", "Pennsylvania", "Wisconsin")

# Initialize a data frame to store the probabilities
swing_probabilities <- data.frame(
  state = swing_states,
  Trump = NA_real_,
  Harris = NA_real_,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Loop through each swing state to calculate win probabilities
for (state in swing_states) {
  if (state %in% all_states) {
    # Retrieve the support vectors for the current state across all simulations
    trump_support <- trump_support_matrix[, state]
    harris_support <- harris_support_matrix[, state]
    
    # Calculate the number of simulations where Trump wins the state
    trump_wins <- sum(trump_support > harris_support, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    # Calculate the number of simulations where Harris wins the state
    harris_wins <- sum(harris_support > trump_support, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    # Calculate the probabilities as percentages
    trump_prob <- (trump_wins / num_simulations) * 100
    harris_prob <- (harris_wins / num_simulations) * 100
    
    # Assign the probabilities to the data frame
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Trump"] <- trump_prob
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Harris"] <- harris_prob
  } else {
    # If the state is not present in the data, assign NA
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Trump"] <- NA
    swing_probabilities[swing_probabilities$state == state, "Harris"] <- NA
    warning(paste("State", state, "is not present in the dataset."))
  }
}

# Optionally, format the probabilities to two decimal places
swing_probabilities <- swing_probabilities %>%
  mutate(
    Trump = round(Trump, 2),
    Harris = round(Harris, 2)
  )

# Print the swing states probability table
print(swing_probabilities)

# Optionally, save the table to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting
write_csv(swing_probabilities, "swing_states_probabilities.csv")

Explanation of the Added Code:Define Swing States:We start by specifying the seven swing states in a vector swing_states.Initialize Probability Data Frame:A new data frame swing_probabilities is created to store the probabilities of each candidate winning each swing state. It has three columns: state, Trump, and Harris.Loop Through Each Swing State:For each state in swing_states, the code checks if the state exists in the all_states vector to ensure it's present in the dataset.It retrieves the support vectors (trump_support and harris_support) for the current state across all simulations.It calculates the number of simulations where Trump and Harris win the state by comparing their support levels.Probabilities are calculated by dividing the number of wins by the total number of simulations (num_simulations) and converting them to percentages.These probabilities are then assigned to the corresponding row in the swing_probabilities data frame.Handling Missing States:If a state from swing_states is not found in all_states, the code assigns NA to both candidates for that state and issues a warning.Formatting and Output:The probabilities are rounded to two decimal places for better readability.The resulting table is printed to the console.Optionally, the table is saved as a CSV file named "swing_states_probabilities.csv" for further analysis or reporting purposes.Example Output:After running the added code, you should see an output similar to the following (note that actual probabilities will depend on your simulation results):markdownCopy code         state Trump Harris
1      Arizona  55.30 44.70
2       Georgia 48.20 51.80
3      Michigan 52.10 47.90
4        Nevada 60.50 39.50
5 North Carolina 49.75 50.25
6  Pennsylvania 53.60 46.40
7     Wisconsin 50.00 50.00
Integration into Existing Script:Place the above code after the existing sections, preferably after Step 6: Summarize Simulation Results. This ensures that the support matrices (trump_support_matrix and harris_support_matrix) are already populated with simulation data required for calculating the swing states probabilities.Additional Considerations:Handling Ties:In the current implementation, ties (where trump_support == harris_support) result in no EV being allocated. If you want to handle ties differently (e.g., randomly assigning the EV or splitting it), you can modify the win condition accordingly.Visualization:For better insights, consider visualizing the swing states probabilities using a bar chart or similar plot. Here's a quick example using ggplot2:rCopy codelibrary(tidyr)

# Convert the data frame to long format for plotting
swing_long <- swing_probabilities %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Trump", "Harris"), names_to = "Candidate", values_to = "Probability")

# Create a bar plot
ggplot(swing_long, aes(x = state, y = Probability, fill = Candidate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Probability of Winning Swing States",
       x = "State",
       y = "Probability (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
Saving the Plot:You can save the plot to a file using ggsave:rCopy codeggsave("swing_states_probabilities_plot.png", width = 10, height = 6)
By adding this section, you'll be able to specifically monitor and report the probabilities of each candidate winning the critical swing states, providing more granular insights into the election simulations.

**Rendering the Document:**

- **In RStudio:**
  - Click the "Render" button (usually a blue button with a Render icon) in the upper right of the editor pane.
  - Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + K` (macOS).

- **Via Command Line:**
  - Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    quarto render report.qmd
    ```

#### **6. Verify the Output**

After rendering, open the resulting HTML (or your chosen format) file to ensure that:

- The table displays correctly with state names and probabilities for both candidates.
- The bar chart accurately represents the data with distinguishable colors for each candidate.
- All elements (titles, labels, captions) are clear and properly formatted.

### **Additional Tips**

1. **Dynamic File Paths:**
   - If your project structure changes or if the CSV file is located in a different directory, ensure that you update the file path in the `read_csv()` function accordingly.
   - Example for a `data/` subdirectory:
     ```r
     swing_probs <- read_csv("data/swing_states_probabilities.csv")
     ```

2. **Automate Data Generation and Reporting:**
   - To maintain consistency and reproducibility, consider integrating the data generation (your R simulation script) and the Quarto report into a single workflow.
   - For instance, you can include the simulation script as part of the Quarto document or set up a Makefile to run the simulation and then render the report.

3. **Handling Missing Data:**
   - Ensure that all swing states are present in the CSV file. If any state is missing, handle it appropriately in the Quarto document to avoid errors in table rendering or plotting.

4. **Enhancing the Report:**
   - **Interactivity:** Use Quarto’s capabilities to add interactive elements, such as interactive tables with `DT` or interactive plots with `plotly`.
   - **Styling:** Customize the appearance of your tables and plots to match your preferred style or branding guidelines.
   - **Additional Analysis:** Include further analysis sections, such as correlations between states, trends over time (if applicable), or comparisons with historical election results.

### **Example Output**

After following the steps above, your Quarto document will display a neatly formatted table and an informative bar chart similar to the example below (actual values will depend on your simulation results):

### **Explanation of the Changes**

1. **Define Custom Colors:**
   
   ```r
   custom_colors <- c("Trump" = "#DD1717", "Harris" = "#0F4392")
This line creates a named vector custom_colors where each candidate is associated with their respective hex color codes.Apply Custom Colors with scale_fill_manual():rCopy codescale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +  # Apply custom colors
The scale_fill_manual() function in ggplot2 allows you to manually specify the colors for the fill aesthetic.By passing the custom_colors vector to the values argument, you ensure that "Trump" bars are colored #DD1717 and "Harris" bars are colored #0F4392.Optional: Adjust Legend Position (Enhancement)rCopy codelegend.position = "top"  # Optional: Position the legend at the top
This line moves the legend to the top of the plot for better visibility. You can adjust or remove this based on your preference.Complete Plot Structure:The rest of the ggplot2 code remains largely unchanged, ensuring that the plot structure and other aesthetics are preserved.Complete Quarto Document with Updated PlotFor clarity, here's how the relevant section of your Quarto document (report.qmd) would look with the updated plotting code:markdownCopy code---

# Introduction

This report presents the results of a Bayesian model-based simulation predicting the outcome of the upcoming US election. Using polling data and historical averages, we simulated 1,000 elections to estimate each candidate's Electoral Votes (EV) and their probabilities of winning key swing states.

# Swing States Probabilities

In this section, we present the probabilities of each candidate winning the seven key swing states based on our 1,000 election simulations.

```{r load-data, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the swing states probabilities CSV
swing_probs <- read_csv("swing_states_probabilities.csv")

# Display the first few rows to verify
head(swing_probs)
Probability TableThe table below shows the probability (%) of each candidate winning the seven swing states based on 1,000 simulations.{rCopy code# Display the swing states probabilities table

  mutate(
    Trump = paste0(Trump, "%"),
    Harris = paste0(Harris, "%")
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Probability of Winning Swing States",
    col.names = c("State", "Trump", "Harris"),
    align = 'c'
  )

  )
ConclusionThe simulation results indicate varying probabilities across the seven key swing states, highlighting the competitive nature of the upcoming election. Monitoring these states closely could provide crucial insights into the overall election outcome.markdownCopy code
### **Rendered Output Example**

After applying the changes, your bar chart will display "Trump" bars in a vibrant red (`#DD1717`) and "Harris" bars in a deep blue (`#0F4392`). Here's an illustrative example of how the chart will appear:

*(Note: Replace the image link with your actual plot after rendering.)*

### **Additional Tips**

1. **Consistency in Color Naming:**
   
   - Ensure that the names in the `custom_colors` vector exactly match the values in the `Candidate` column of your `swing_long` data frame. This ensures that colors are correctly mapped.
   
2. **Enhancing Accessibility:**
   
   - Consider colorblind-friendly palettes if your audience might have color vision deficiencies. The chosen hex codes are distinct, but always verify for accessibility.
   
3. **Saving the Plot:**
   
   - If you wish to save the plot separately, you can add `ggsave()` after the plotting code:
     
     ```r
     ggsave("swing_states_probabilities_plot.png", width = 8, height = 6)
     ```
   
   - This command saves the plot as a PNG file with the specified dimensions.
   
4. **Interactive Plots (Optional Enhancement):**
   
   - For interactive visualizations, consider using `plotly`:
     
     ```r
     library(plotly)
     
     p <- ggplot(swing_long, aes(x = state, y = Probability, fill = Candidate)) +
       geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
       scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +
       labs(
         title = "Probability of Winning Swing States",
         x = "State",
         y = "Probability (%)",
         fill = "Candidate"
       ) +
       theme_minimal() +
       theme(
         text = element_text(size = 12),
         plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
         legend.position = "top"
       )
     
     ggplotly(p)
     ```
   
   - Interactive plots allow users to hover over bars to see exact values and can enhance engagement.

5. **Alternative Visualizations:**
   
   - **Faceted Bar Charts:** Create separate panels for each candidate.
   - **Stacked Bar Charts:** Show cumulative probabilities.
   - **Dot Plots:** Represent probabilities with dots for a minimalist approach.

### **Final Thoughts**

By customizing your bar chart with specific hex colors, you enhance the visual differentiation between candidates, making your report more intuitive and visually appealing. Ensure to render your Quarto document after making these changes to see the updates reflected in the output.

If you encounter any issues or need further customization, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT: Certainly! Customizing the colors of your bar chart to match specific hex codes enhances the visual appeal and ensures consistency with your branding or presentation preferences. In your case, you want:Trump: #DD1717 (a shade of red)Harris: #0F4392 (a shade of blue)Below, I'll guide you through updating your Quarto document's plotting section to incorporate these colors.Updated Plotting Code with Custom ColorsModify the plotting section in your Quarto document as follows to apply the specified colors:markdownCopy code## Visualization of Swing States Probabilities
