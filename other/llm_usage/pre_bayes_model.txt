Error: Duplicated prior specifications are not allowed.

I am trying to fit a multilevel bayesian model to predict the outcome of the us election. I want to set different priors to each state as states tend to vote very differently, does this make sense? I am also getting Error when i try to fit the harris model, why might that be?

I am trying to fit a multilevel bayesian model to predict the outcome of the us election. I want to set different priors to each state as states tend to vote very differently, does this make sense? I am also getting Error when i try to fit the harris model, why might that be?
ChatGPT: Yes, setting different priors for each state makes sense in your context because states often have consistent voting patterns, and incorporating this historical information can improve your model's predictions.The error you're encountering:javascriptCopy codeError: Duplicated prior specifications are not allowed.
occurs because of how you're combining prior specifications in your code. Specifically, you're using the + operator to combine priors, which is not appropriate in this context. In R, the + operator is used for arithmetic addition, not for concatenating lists or vectors of prior specifications.Here's why this is causing an error:The + operator does not correctly combine the prior objects, leading to unintended duplication of prior specifications.As a result, some coefficients end up with multiple prior specifications, which brms does not allow, hence the error message about duplicated prior specifications.Solution:You should use the c() function to concatenate your prior specifications into a single vector. Here's how you can modify your code:rCopy code# Initialize priors
priors_harris <- c(
  prior(normal(50, 10), class = "Intercept")
)

# Add custom priors for state effects
for (i in 1:nrow(harris_priors)) {
  priors_harris <- c(
    priors_harris,
    prior(
      eval(parse(text = harris_priors$prior[i])),
      class = "b",
      coef = harris_priors$coef[i]
    )

  )
}
Explanation:Initialization: Start with your prior for the intercept as a vector using c().Adding Priors for State Effects: Use c(priors_harris, new_prior) to concatenate the new prior to the existing vector.Adding Priors for Other Coefficients: Similarly, use c() to add priors for other fixed-effect coefficients.Additional Tips:Check Coefficient Names: Ensure that the coefficient names (coef) in your prior specifications exactly match those used internally by brms. You can verify this by inspecting priors_info from the get_prior() function.Reference Levels: Remember that factors in R (like your state variable) have a reference level, and brms will not create a coefficient for this level. You don't need to set a prior for the reference level's coefficient because it doesn't exist.Avoid Duplicates: Make sure you're not setting priors multiple times for the same coefficient, as this will cause the duplication error you're seeing.By making these changes, your model should run without the duplication error, allowing you to set different priors for each state effectively.Summary:Replace the + operator with c() when combining prior specifications.Ensure coefficient names in priors match those in the model.Avoid setting multiple priors for the same coefficient.

these states dont have poll data, but i still want them to have their historical state priors
ChatGPT: Yes, I understand your concern. You want to assign historical priors to all states, including those without poll data, but you're finding that some states are ending up in other_coefs and receiving default priors instead. This happens because those states are not included in your harris_priors data frame, so they end up in other_coefs when you perform the setdiff operation.Here's what's happening:States Without Poll Data: These states don't appear in your poll_data_harris data frame.Coefficient Names in Model: When you run get_prior(), it includes coefficients for all levels of the state factor, even if some states have no observations in your data.Mismatch in Priors: Because you haven't set priors for these states (since they weren't in your data), they end up with the default priors specified in other_coefs, which is not what you want.Solution:To ensure that all states receive their historical priors, you need to adjust your harris_priors to include all state coefficients that are in the model, even those for states without poll data.Here's how you can modify your code:Adjust the Factor Levels:First, ensure that the state factor in your poll_data includes all states, even those not present in the data. You can achieve this by specifying the levels explicitly using the historical data.rCopy codeall_states <- unique(state_historical_averages$state)

poll_data <- poll_data %>%
  mutate(
    state = factor(state, levels = all_states),
    candidate = factor(candidate)
  )
Extract All State Coefficient Names:Use get_prior() to extract the coefficient names for all states included in the model.rCopy code# Get prior information from the model
priors_info <- get_prior(
  formula = formula_harris,
  data = poll_data_harris,
  family = gaussian()
)

# Extract state coefficient names
state_coefs_in_model <- priors_info %>%
  filter(class == 'b', grepl('^state', coef)) %>%
  mutate(state = sub('^state', '', coef)) %>%
  select(coef, state)
Create harris_priors Including All States:Merge the state_coefs_in_model with your harris_state_effects to ensure that you have prior means for all states in the model.rCopy codeharris_priors <- state_coefs_in_model %>%
  left_join(harris_state_effects, by = 'state') %>%
  mutate(
    prior = paste0('normal(', prior_mean, ', 5)')
  )
Initialize and Build the Priors:Now, construct your priors_harris by including the priors for all state coefficients.rCopy code# Initialize priors
priors_harris <- c(
  prior(normal(50, 10), class = "Intercept")
)

# Add custom priors for state effects
for (i in 1:nrow(harris_priors)) {
  priors_harris <- c(
    priors_harris,
    prior(
      eval(parse(text = harris_priors$prior[i])),
      class = "b",
      coef = harris_priors$coef[i]
    )
  )
}

# Extract names of all fixed-effect coefficients
b_coefs <- priors_info %>%

# Add priors for other fixed-effect coefficients
for (coef in other_coefs) {
  priors_harris <- c(
    priors_harris,
    prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b", coef = coef)
  )
}
Fit the Model:With the priors correctly specified for all states, you can now fit your model.rCopy code# Fit the model

  family = gaussian(),
  prior = priors_harris,
  seed = 123,
  chains = 4,
  iter = 2000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
)
Explanation:Including All States in the Factor Levels:By specifying levels = all_states when creating the state factor, you ensure that all states are recognized by the model, even if they don't have observations in your dataset.Matching Coefficient Names:The coefficient names in harris_priors must match those in the model exactly. By extracting the coefficient names from priors_info and merging with your historical data, you ensure this alignment.Avoiding Default Priors for States Without Data:By including all state coefficients in your harris_priors, you prevent them from ending up in other_coefs and receiving default priors.Additional Notes:Reference Level:Remember that one of the levels of your state factor will be used as the reference level (usually the first level alphabetically or as specified). This reference level does not have a coefficient in the model. You cannot set a prior for it, but its effect is captured in the intercept.Missing Historical Data:If your harris_state_effects does not contain historical averages for certain states, make sure to handle NA values appropriately. You might assign a default prior mean (e.g., 50) for those states.rCopy codeharris_priors <- harris_priors %>%
  mutate(
    prior_mean = ifelse(is.na(prior_mean), 50, prior_mean),
    prior = paste0('normal(', prior_mean, ', 5)')
  )
Summary:Adjust your factor levels to include all states.Extract coefficient names directly from the model's prior information.Ensure that you set priors for all state coefficients in the model.Avoid states without data ending up in other_coefs by including them in your priors.By following these steps, you'll assign historical priors to all states, even those without poll data, ensuring that your model accurately reflects your prior knowledge about each state's voting tendencies.
ChatGPT: Yes, I understand your concern. You want to assign historical priors to all states, including those without poll data, but you're finding that some states are ending up in other_coefs and receiving default priors instead. This happens because those states are not included in your harris_priors data frame, so they end up in other_coefs when you perform the setdiff operation.Here's what's happening:States Without Poll Data: These states don't appear in your poll_data_harris data frame.Coefficient Names in Model: When you run get_prior(), it includes coefficients for all levels of the state factor, even if some states have no observations in your data.Mismatch in Priors: Because you haven't set priors for these states (since they weren't in your data), they end up with the default priors specified in other_coefs, which is not what you want.Solution:To ensure that all states receive their historical priors, you need to adjust your harris_priors to include all state coefficients that are in the model, even those for states without poll data.Here's how you can modify your code:Adjust the Factor Levels:First, ensure that the state factor in your poll_data includes all states, even those not present in the data. You can achieve this by specifying the levels explicitly using the historical data.rCopy codeall_states <- unique(state_historical_averages$state)

poll_data <- poll_data %>%
  mutate(
    state = factor(state, levels = all_states),
    candidate = factor(candidate)
  )
Extract All State Coefficient Names:Use get_prior() to extract the coefficient names for all states included in the model.rCopy code# Get prior information from the model
priors_info <- get_prior(
  formula = formula_harris,
  data = poll_data_harris,
  family = gaussian()
)

# Extract state coefficient names
state_coefs_in_model <- priors_info %>%
  filter(class == 'b', grepl('^state', coef)) %>%
  mutate(state = sub('^state', '', coef)) %>%
  select(coef, state)
Create harris_priors Including All States:Merge the state_coefs_in_model with your harris_state_effects to ensure that you have prior means for all states in the model.rCopy codeharris_priors <- state_coefs_in_model %>%
  left_join(harris_state_effects, by = 'state') %>%
  mutate(
    prior = paste0('normal(', prior_mean, ', 5)')
  )
Initialize and Build the Priors:Now, construct your priors_harris by including the priors for all state coefficients.rCopy code# Initialize priors
priors_harris <- c(
  prior(normal(50, 10), class = "Intercept")
)

# Add custom priors for state effects
for (i in 1:nrow(harris_priors)) {
  priors_harris <- c(
    priors_harris,
    prior(
      eval(parse(text = harris_priors$prior[i])),
      class = "b",
      coef = harris_priors$coef[i]
    )
  )
}

# Extract names of all fixed-effect coefficients
b_coefs <- priors_info %>%
  filter(class == 'b', !is.na(coef)) %>%
  pull(coef)

# Identify other coefficients (non-state coefficients)
other_coefs <- setdiff(b_coefs, harris_priors$coef)

# Add priors for other fixed-effect coefficients
for (coef in other_coefs) {
  priors_harris <- c(
    priors_harris,
    prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b", coef = coef)
  )
}
Fit the Model:With the priors correctly specified for all states, you can now fit your model.rCopy code# Fit the model
model_harris <- brm(
  formula = formula_harris,
  data = poll_data_harris,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = priors_harris,
  seed = 123,
  chains = 4,
  iter = 2000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
)
Explanation:Including All States in the Factor Levels:By specifying levels = all_states when creating the state factor, you ensure that all states are recognized by the model, even if they don't have observations in your dataset.Matching Coefficient Names:The coefficient names in harris_priors must match those in the model exactly. By extracting the coefficient names from priors_info and merging with your historical data, you ensure this alignment.Avoiding Default Priors for States Without Data:By including all state coefficients in your harris_priors, you prevent them from ending up in other_coefs and receiving default priors.Additional Notes:Reference Level:Remember that one of the levels of your state factor will be used as the reference level (usually the first level alphabetically or as specified). This reference level does not have a coefficient in the model.

Explanation of ChangesIncluded All States in Factor Levels:Ensured that the state factor includes all states by setting levels = all_states when mutating the state variable in poll_data.Adjusted Prior Specifications:Replaced the + operator with c() when combining prior specifications to prevent duplication errors.Created harris_priors and trump_priors by merging coefficient names from get_prior() with historical averages, ensuring all state coefficients have specified priors.Set a default prior mean (e.g., 50) for states without historical data to avoid NA values in priors.Handled States Without Poll Data:Created new data frames new_data_harris and new_data_trump for prediction, which include all states.Used the mean of each predictor variable from the available poll data to fill in the necessary columns for prediction.Generated Predictions for All States:Used posterior_epred() with the new data frames to generate predictions for all states, including those without poll data.Combined and Handled Missing Values:In the state_results data frame, used historical averages to fill in any missing prediction values.Consistency Between Harris and Trump Models:Applied the same adjustments to both the Harris and Trump models to ensure consistency.Additional NotesDefault Priors for Missing Historical Data:If there are states with missing historical averages, you can adjust the default prior_mean value in the code (currently set to 50) to a value that makes sense in your context.Reference Level in Factors:Remember that the first level in your factor (by default, the first in alphabetical order) will be the reference level and does not get a coefficient in the model. You cannot set a prior for it, but its effect is included in the intercept.Error Handling:Ensure that all required data files (cleaned_poll_data.csv, cleaned_historical_data.csv, and electoral_votes.csv) are present in the data directory.Model Diagnostics:After fitting the models, consider checking diagnostics (e.g., trace plots, R-hat values) to ensure that the models have converged properly.Running the CodeDependencies:Make sure that the tidyverse, rstanarm, and brms packages are installed and loaded.You might need to install additional packages or update existing ones if you encounter any issues.Computation Time:Bayesian models can take a considerable amount of time to run, especially with a large number of parameters. Be patient while the models are fitting.Reproducibility:The seed parameter is set to 123 in both models to ensure reproducibility of results.By using this code, you should be able to fit the models for both Harris and Trump, generate predictions for all states (including those without poll data), and calculate the expected electoral votes for each candidate.Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

Explanation of ChangesIncluded All States in Factor Levels:Ensured that the state factor includes all states by setting levels = all_states when mutating the state variable in poll_data.Adjusted Prior Specifications:Replaced the + operator with c() when combining prior specifications to prevent duplication errors.Created harris_priors and trump_priors by merging coefficient names from get_prior() with historical averages, ensuring all state coefficients have specified priors.Set a default prior mean (e.g., 50) for states without historical data to avoid NA values in priors.Handled States Without Poll Data:Created new data frames new_data_harris and new_data_trump for prediction, which include all states.Used the mean of each predictor variable from the available poll data to fill in the necessary columns for prediction.Generated Predictions for All States:Used posterior_epred() with the new data frames to generate predictions for all states, including those without poll data.Combined and Handled Missing Values:In the state_results data frame, used historical averages to fill in any missing prediction values.Consistency Between Harris and Trump Models:Applied the same adjustments to both the Harris and Trump models to ensure consistency.Additional NotesDefault Priors for Missing Historical Data:If there are states with missing historical averages, you can adjust the default prior_mean value in the code (currently set to 50) to a value that makes sense in your context.Reference Level in Factors:Remember that the first level in your factor (by default, the first in alphabetical order) will be the reference level and does not get a coefficient in the model. You cannot set a prior for it, but its effect is included in the intercept.Error Handling:Ensure that all required data files (cleaned_poll_data.csv, cleaned_historical_data.csv, and electoral_votes.csv) are present in the data directory.Model Diagnostics:After fitting the models, consider checking diagnostics (e.g., trace plots, R-hat values) to ensure that the models have converged properly.Running the CodeDependencies:Make sure that the tidyverse, rstanarm, and brms packages are installed and loaded.You might need to install additional packages or update existing ones if you encounter any issues.Computation Time:Bayesian models can take a considerable amount of time to run, especially with a large number of parameters. Be patient while the models are fitting.Reproducibility:The seed parameter is set to 123 in both models to ensure reproducibility of results.By using this code, you should be able to fit the models for both Harris and Trump, generate predictions for all states (including those without poll data), and calculate the expected electoral votes for each candidate.Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

Error: Duplicated prior specifications are not allowed.

I am still getting this error, the table is priors_harris
ChatGPT: I understand that you're still encountering the error:javascriptCopy codeError: Duplicated prior specifications are not allowed.
This issue arises because the eval(parse(...)) expressions in your prior specifications are not being evaluated as you expect. Instead, they are being included literally in your prior specifications, causing duplication and leading to the error.The brms package provides a function prior_string() that allows you to specify priors using strings directly, which is more appropriate in this context. By using prior_string(), you can avoid the issues associated with eval(parse(...)).Solution:Here's the corrected and complete code that addresses the error. I've replaced the eval(parse(...)) with prior_string() and adjusted the code accordingly for both the Harris and Trump models.rCopy code#### Preamble ####

Explanation of ChangesReplaced eval(parse(...)) with prior_string():Instead of using eval(parse(...)), which was causing the issue, I used prior_string() to specify the priors using strings directly.This ensures that the prior specifications are correctly interpreted by brms and avoids duplication.Combined Priors Correctly:Used do.call(c, ...) to combine the list of priors into a single brmsprior object.This approach prevents any duplication and ensures all priors are correctly specified.Handled Other Coefficients:Added a check to ensure that if there are other coefficients (non-state coefficients), they receive the default prior.This prevents any potential issues with missing priors for these coefficients.Key PointsAvoid eval(parse(...)) in Prior Specifications:Using eval(parse(...)) inside the prior() function doesn't work as intended because prior() doesn't evaluate the expression in that way.Instead, the unevaluated expression was being included literally in your prior specifications, leading to duplication.Use prior_string() for String Priors:prior_string() is designed to accept prior specifications as strings, which is exactly what you need when your prior parameters are stored as strings.This function ensures that the prior is correctly interpreted by brms.Combining Priors:When combining priors, use c() to concatenate brmsprior objects.If you have a list of priors (e.g., from lapply), use do.call(c, ...) to combine them into a single object.Check for Duplicates:Ensure that each coefficient has only one prior specified.Duplicates occur when multiple priors are assigned to the same coefficient, which brms doesn't allow.Additional TipsInspecting Priors:You can inspect your prior specifications by printing priors_harris or priors_trump to ensure they are correctly specified.Example:rCopy codeprint(priors_harris)
Reference Level:Remember that the reference level of your factor (usually the first level) does not get a coefficient and thus doesn't need a prior.In your case, the state with the reference level is included in the intercept.Consistency Between Models:Apply the same methodology to both the Harris and Trump models to ensure consistency in your analysis.Model Diagnostics:After fitting the models, check the convergence diagnostics (e.g., R-hat values, effective sample size) to ensure the models have converged properly.Example:rCopy codesummary(model_harris)
Data Availability:Make sure that all data files (cleaned_poll_data.csv, cleaned_historical_data.csv, electoral_votes.csv) are correctly formatted and located in the specified directories.Computational Resources:Bayesian models can be computationally intensive. Ensure you have sufficient resources, and consider reducing the number of iterations if necessary.ConclusionBy implementing these changes, you should be able to run your models without encountering the duplication error. The use of prior_string() allows you to specify custom priors for each state's effect, accurately reflecting your prior knowledge of the states' historical voting patterns.Let me know if you have any further questions or if you encounter any other issues!

Explanation of ChangesReplaced eval(parse(...)) with prior_string():Instead of using eval(parse(...)), which was causing the issue, I used prior_string() to specify the priors using strings directly.This ensures that the prior specifications are correctly interpreted by brms and avoids duplication.Combined Priors Correctly:Used do.call(c, ...) to combine the list of priors into a single brmsprior object.This approach prevents any duplication and ensures all priors are correctly specified.Handled Other Coefficients:Added a check to ensure that if there are other coefficients (non-state coefficients), they receive the default prior.This prevents any potential issues with missing priors for these coefficients.Key PointsAvoid eval(parse(...)) in Prior Specifications:Using eval(parse(...)) inside the prior() function doesn't work as intended because prior() doesn't evaluate the expression in that way.Instead, the unevaluated expression was being included literally in your prior specifications, leading to duplication.Use prior_string() for String Priors:prior_string() is designed to accept prior specifications as strings, which is exactly what you need when your prior parameters are stored as strings.This function ensures that the prior is correctly interpreted by brms.Combining Priors:When combining priors, use c() to concatenate brmsprior objects.If you have a list of priors (e.g., from lapply), use do.call(c, ...) to combine them into a single object.Check for Duplicates:Ensure that each coefficient has only one prior specified.Duplicates occur when multiple priors are assigned to the same coefficient, which brms doesn't allow.Additional TipsInspecting Priors:You can inspect your prior specifications by printing priors_harris or priors_trump to ensure they are correctly specified.Example:rCopy codeprint(priors_harris)
Reference Level:Remember that the reference level of your factor (usually the first level) does not get a coefficient and thus doesn't need a prior.In your case, the state with the reference level is included in the intercept.Consistency Between Models:Apply the same methodology to both the Harris and Trump models to ensure consistency in your analysis.Model Diagnostics:After fitting the models, check the convergence diagnostics (e.g., R-hat values, effective sample size) to ensure the models have converged properly.Example:rCopy codesummary(model_harris)
Data Availability:Make sure that all data files (cleaned_poll_data.csv, cleaned_historical_data.csv, electoral_votes.csv) are correctly formatted and located in the specified directories.Computational Resources:Bayesian models can be computationally intensive. Ensure you have sufficient resources, and consider reducing the number of iterations if necessary.ConclusionBy implementing these changes, you should be able to run your models without encountering the duplication error. The use of prior_string() allows you to specify custom priors for each state's effect, accurately reflecting your prior knowledge of the states' historical voting patterns.Let me know if you have any further questions or if you encounter any other issues!

ChatGPT: I apologize for the continued issues you're experiencing. The error:typescriptCopy codeError: The following priors do not correspond to any model parameter: 
b_other_coefs_harris ~ normal(0, 5)
occurs because the prior() function in brms does not accept a vector of coefficient names in the coef argument. When you pass other_coefs_harris, which is a vector of coefficient names, to prior(), it doesn't recognize it correctly and creates an incorrect prior specification.Solution:Instead of attempting to assign priors to multiple coefficients at once using a vector, you need to assign priors to each coefficient individually. Alternatively, since you want the same prior for all other fixed-effect coefficients (non-state coefficients), you can set a default prior for all coefficients of class "b" and then specify individual priors for the state coefficients. Here's how you can adjust your code:Steps:Set a default prior for all fixed effects (class = "b").Specify individual priors for state coefficients.Avoid setting priors for non-existent coefficients.Corrected Code:Below is the corrected code for both the Harris and Trump models, with explanations for the changes made.rCopy code#### Preamble ####

Explanation of Changes1. Setting Default Priors for Fixed Effects (class = "b")Issue:Previously, we attempted to assign priors to all other coefficients by specifying the coef argument with a vector of coefficient names (other_coefs_harris), which caused the error.Solution:Set a default prior for all fixed effects (coefficients of class "b") using:rCopy codeprior(normal(0, 5), class = "b")
This prior applies to all fixed-effect coefficients that do not have a specific prior assigned to them.Implementation:Included the default prior in priors_harris and priors_trump:rCopy codepriors_harris <- c(
  prior(normal(50, 10), class = "Intercept"),
  prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b")
)
2. Specifying Priors for State Coefficients IndividuallyIssue:The state coefficients require individual priors based on historical data.Solution:Use prior_string() to specify priors for each state coefficient individually.Implementation:Created a list of priors for state coefficients using lapply():rCopy codestate_priors_harris <- lapply(1:nrow(harris_priors_df), function(i) {
  prior_string(
    harris_priors_df$prior[i],
    class = "b",
    coef = harris_priors_df$coef[i]
  )
})
Combined these priors with the default priors:rCopy codepriors_harris <- c(priors_harris, do.call(c, state_priors_harris))
3. Avoiding Duplicate Priors and Non-Existent CoefficientsIssue:Assigning priors to coefficients that do not exist in the model or assigning multiple priors to the same coefficient causes errors.Solution:By setting a default prior for all fixed effects and specifying individual priors for state coefficients, we avoid duplicates and ensure all coefficients have appropriate priors.Additional NotesWhy Use prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b")?This sets a default prior for all fixed-effect coefficients that do not have an individually specified prior.Since we have set specific priors for the state coefficients, the default prior applies to the other predictors (e.g., sample_size, days_to_election, etc.).The default prior will not override the specific priors set for the state coefficients.Ensuring Coefficient Names Match:Coefficient names must match exactly between the priors and the model.By extracting the coefficient names from get_prior(), we ensure consistency.Reference Level:The reference level of the state factor does not have a coefficient (it's included in the intercept).We do not need to set a prior for the reference level.Inspecting Priors:You can inspect the final prior specifications by printing priors_harris or using prior_summary(model_harris) after fitting the model.Model Diagnostics:After fitting the model, check convergence diagnostics:rCopy codesummary(model_harris)
rCopy codeplot(model_harris)
Ensure that R-hat values are close to 1 and that the effective sample sizes are sufficient.ConclusionBy making these adjustments, the error should be resolved, and the models should fit correctly. Setting a default prior for all fixed effects (class = "b") and specifying individual priors for the state coefficients ensures that all coefficients have appropriate priors without duplication or mismatches.Please replace your existing code with the corrected code above, and let me know if you encounter any further issues or have any questions!

Explanation of Changes1. Setting Default Priors for Fixed Effects (class = "b")Issue:Previously, we attempted to assign priors to all other coefficients by specifying the coef argument with a vector of coefficient names (other_coefs_harris), which caused the error.Solution:Set a default prior for all fixed effects (coefficients of class "b") using:rCopy codeprior(normal(0, 5), class = "b")
This prior applies to all fixed-effect coefficients that do not have a specific prior assigned to them.Implementation:Included the default prior in priors_harris and priors_trump:rCopy codepriors_harris <- c(
  prior(normal(50, 10), class = "Intercept"),
  prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b")
)
2. Specifying Priors for State Coefficients IndividuallyIssue:The state coefficients require individual priors based on historical data.Solution:Use prior_string() to specify priors for each state coefficient individually.Implementation:Created a list of priors for state coefficients using lapply():rCopy codestate_priors_harris <- lapply(1:nrow(harris_priors_df), function(i) {
  prior_string(
    harris_priors_df$prior[i],
    class = "b",
    coef = harris_priors_df$coef[i]
  )
})
Combined these priors with the default priors:rCopy codepriors_harris <- c(priors_harris, do.call(c, state_priors_harris))
3. Avoiding Duplicate Priors and Non-Existent CoefficientsIssue:Assigning priors to coefficients that do not exist in the model or assigning multiple priors to the same coefficient causes errors.Solution:By setting a default prior for all fixed effects and specifying individual priors for state coefficients, we avoid duplicates and ensure all coefficients have appropriate priors.Additional NotesWhy Use prior(normal(0, 5), class = "b")?This sets a default prior for all fixed-effect coefficients that do not have an individually specified prior.Since we have set specific priors for the state coefficients, the default prior applies to the other predictors (e.g., sample_size, days_to_election, etc.).The default prior will not override the specific priors set for the state coefficients.Ensuring Coefficient Names Match:Coefficient names must match exactly between the priors and the model.By extracting the coefficient names from get_prior(), we ensure consistency.Reference Level:The reference level of the state factor does not have a coefficient (it's included in the intercept).We do not need to set a prior for the reference level.Inspecting Priors:You can inspect the final prior specifications by printing priors_harris or using prior_summary(model_harris) after fitting the model.Model Diagnostics:After fitting the model, check convergence diagnostics:rCopy codesummary(model_harris)
rCopy codeplot(model_harris)
Ensure that R-hat values are close to 1 and that the effective sample sizes are sufficient.ConclusionBy making these adjustments, the error should be resolved, and the models should fit correctly. Setting a default prior for all fixed effects (class = "b") and specifying individual priors for the state coefficients ensures that all coefficients have appropriate priors without duplication or mismatches.Please replace your existing code with the corrected code above, and let me know if you encounter any further issues or have any questions!
