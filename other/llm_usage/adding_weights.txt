Polls are weighted based on the pollster's historical accuracy (using the square root of the 538 pollster rating), with adjustments to prevent any single pollster from dominating the average. Sample sizes are capped to limit the influence of overly large polls.

what would be the r code that i would use to do that, before i run my regression

To weight your polls based on the 538 methodology before running your regression, you can use the following R code. This code calculates weights using the square root of the 538 pollster rating, adjusts for pollsters who have released multiple polls within a 14-day window, and caps sample sizes at 5,000 to prevent any single poll from having too much influence.

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Assuming your dataset is loaded into a data frame called 'polls_data'

# 1. Cap sample sizes at 5,000
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(sample_size_capped = pmin(sample_size, 5000))

# 2. Calculate initial weight based on pollster rating
# If pollster_rating is NA (unrated), set weight to 1
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(
    initial_weight = ifelse(
      is.na(pollster_rating),
      1,
      sqrt(pollster_rating / 3)
    )
  )

# 3. Normalize weights by dividing by the average weight
average_weight <- mean(polls_data$initial_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(weight = initial_weight / average_weight)

# 4. Adjust weights for pollster frequency in the last 14 days
# Calculate the number of polls released by each pollster in the last 14 days
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  arrange(pollster, end_date) %>%
  group_by(pollster) %>%
  mutate(
    number_of_polls_in_14_days = sapply(end_date, function(current_date) {
      sum(end_date >= (current_date - 13) & end_date <= current_date)
    })
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Adjust the weight to prevent any pollster from dominating
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(weight = weight / sqrt(number_of_polls_in_14_days))

# Now your 'polls_data' includes the 'weight' column for use in regression
Explanation of the Code:

Cap Sample Sizes:

r
Copy code
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(sample_size_capped = pmin(sample_size, 5000))
Purpose: Limits the sample size to a maximum of 5,000 to prevent large polls from having undue influence.
Calculate Initial Weight Based on Pollster Rating:

r
Copy code
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(
    initial_weight = ifelse(
      is.na(pollster_rating),
      1,  # Assign a weight of 1 to unrated pollsters
      sqrt(pollster_rating / 3)
    )
  )
Purpose: Polls are weighted by the square root of the pollster's rating divided by the maximum rating (3 stars). Unrated pollsters are given a neutral weight of 1.
Normalize Weights:

r
Copy code
average_weight <- mean(polls_data$initial_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(weight = initial_weight / average_weight)
Purpose: Divides each poll's initial weight by the average weight to normalize the weights across all polls.
Adjust Weights for Pollster Frequency:

r
Copy code
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  arrange(pollster, end_date) %>%
  group_by(pollster) %>%
  mutate(
    number_of_polls_in_14_days = sapply(end_date, function(current_date) {
      sum(end_date >= (current_date - 13) & end_date <= current_date)
    })
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(weight = weight / sqrt(number_of_polls_in_14_days))
Purpose: Reduces the weight of polls from pollsters who have released multiple polls in the last 14 days by dividing by the square root of the number of such polls. This prevents any single pollster from dominating the average due to high frequency.
Using the Weights in Regression:

After calculating the weights, you can include them in your regression model:

r
Copy code
# Run the weighted regression
model <- lm(
  support ~ pollster_rating + methodology + sample_size_capped + days_to_election + party,
  data = polls_data,
  weights = weight
)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)
Note:

The weights parameter in the lm() function applies the calculated weights to each observation.
Make sure all your variables are properly formatted (e.g., factors, numeric) before running the regression.
Additional Considerations:

Pollster Ratings: Ensure that the pollster_rating variable is correctly populated with numerical values corresponding to the 538 ratings.
Data Completeness: Check for missing values in critical columns and handle them appropriately.
Variable Encoding: Convert categorical variables like methodology and party to factors if they are not already.
Example with Your Data:

Assuming your sample data is stored in polls_data, here's how the complete code would look:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Your sample data (replace this with your actual data)
polls_data <- data.frame(
  poll_id = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  pollster = c('ActiVote', 'ActiVote', 'Data for Progress', 'Data for Progress'),
  pollster_rating = c(NA, NA, 2.6, 2.6),
  methodology = c('Live Phone/Text-to-Web/App Panel', 'Live Phone/Text-to-Web/App Panel', 'Online Panel', 'Online Panel'),
  sample_size = c(400, 400, 1211, 1211),
  end_date = as.Date(c('2024-10-05', '2024-10-05', '2024-10-03', '2024-10-03')),
  candidate_name = c('Kamala Harris', 'Donald Trump', 'Kamala Harris', 'Donald Trump'),
  party = c('DEM', 'REP', 'DEM', 'REP'),
  support = c(55, 45, 52, 48)  # Example support percentages
)

# Cap sample sizes at 5,000
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(sample_size_capped = pmin(sample_size, 5000))

# Calculate initial weight based on pollster rating
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(
    initial_weight = ifelse(
      is.na(pollster_rating),
      1,
      sqrt(pollster_rating / 3)
    )
  )

# Normalize weights
average_weight <- mean(polls_data$initial_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(weight = initial_weight / average_weight)

# Adjust weights for pollster frequency
polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  arrange(pollster, end_date) %>%
  group_by(pollster) %>%
  mutate(
    number_of_polls_in_14_days = sapply(end_date, function(current_date) {
      sum(end_date >= (current_date - 13) & end_date <= current_date)
    })
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

polls_data <- polls_data %>%
  mutate(weight = weight / sqrt(number_of_polls_in_14_days))

# Run the weighted regression
model <- lm(
  support ~ methodology + sample_size_capped + party,
  data = polls_data,
  weights = weight
)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)
Summary:

By incorporating these weights into your analysis, you align your methodology more closely with 538's approach. This ensures that your pooled polling data accounts for pollster quality, prevents domination by any single pollster, and limits the influence of unusually large sample sizes.
