Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting pdf output. Please change the output type of this document to HTML. If you're aiming to have some HTML widgets shown in non-HTML format as a screenshot, please install webshot or webshot2 R package for knitr to do the screenshot, and configure it by looking at its documentation. Alternatively, you can allow HTML output in non-HTML formats by adding this option to the YAML front-matter of your quarto file:    prefer-html: true  Note however that the HTML output will not be visible in non-HTML formats.

If you’re seeing this error, it’s likely that Quarto is still having trouble interpreting the HTML widget for PDF output. Let’s address it by ensuring that webshot or webshot2 is properly configured and, alternatively, enabling prefer-html: true in your YAML front matter. Here’s a step-by-step solution:

1. Enable Screenshots with webshot2
Ensure that you’re using webshot2, which is often more compatible with modern setups. After installing it, use this configuration:

r
Copy code
install.packages("webshot2")
2. Add prefer-html: true to YAML Front Matter
The prefer-html: true setting in the YAML front matter can help Quarto recognize and attempt rendering for non-HTML formats.

Here’s how your YAML header should look:

markdown
Copy code
---
title: "HTML Widget Screenshot Example"
format:
  pdf:
    prefer-html: true
  html: default
---
3. Confirm Webshot is Enabled in Quarto
Add a setup chunk to configure knitr with webshot enabled. This allows HTML widgets to be automatically converted to images when rendering to non-HTML formats:

r
Copy code
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(webshot = TRUE)
less
Copy code

### 4. Ensure Quarto is Using the `webshot2` Package
Make sure that your plotly (or other widget) chunks don’t explicitly call HTML outputs, as that can still cause issues when rendering to PDF.

For example:

```markdown
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a sample plotly widget
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = ~rnorm(100), y = ~rnorm(100), type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers')
vbnet
Copy code

### 5. Render the Document
After these changes, try rendering the document again. 

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Check for PhantomJS Installation**: If using `webshot` instead of `webshot2`, ensure PhantomJS is correctly installed.
- **Use Quarto CLI**: If you’re using a command line, you can also try rendering with `quarto render yourfile.qmd --to pdf` to catch more detailed error messages.
