If you have a column of names in R with some repeated entries and you want to find all the unique names, you can use the unique() function. Here's an example:
Assume you have a data frame with a column called names:
r
Copy code
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(names = c("Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "David", "Eve", "Bob"))

# Get unique names
unique_names <- unique(df$names)
print(unique_names)
This will return all the distinct names from the names column, eliminating duplicates.
Alternatively, if you want to know the frequency of each name (i.e., how many times each name appears), you can use the table() function:
r
Copy code
# Get frequency of each name
name_counts <- table(df$names)
print(name_counts)
This will display each name along with its count.
