why is kamala and trump empty, they should be the highest

If Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are showing as empty in the plot, it might be due to one or more of the following reasons:

Possible Issues:
Spelling or Data Entry Errors: There might be inconsistencies in how the candidates' names are recorded (e.g., "Kamala Harris" vs. "Kamala" or "Trump" vs. "Donald Trump").

Missing Sample Sizes: If sample_size values for these candidates are missing (i.e., NA values), the sum could exclude them from the results.

Filtering or Data Cleaning: The cleaned_poll_data dataset might have been filtered in a way that unintentionally excluded some rows for these candidates.

Debugging Steps:
To diagnose and fix the issue, check the following:

1. Check Candidate Names
Run this code to check the unique candidate names in your data:

r
Copy code
unique(cleaned_poll_data$`Candidate Favored`)
This will help you identify if there are inconsistencies or spelling differences in the candidate names.

2. Check for Missing Sample Sizes
Check if there are any NA values in the sample_size column for these candidates:

r
Copy code
cleaned_poll_data |> 
  filter(`Candidate Favored` %in% c("Kamala", "Trump")) |> 
  summarise(missing_sample_size = sum(is.na(sample_size)))
If there are missing values, you’ll need to either handle them (e.g., replace with a default value or remove those rows) or adjust how you sum the sample_size.

3. Check Data for Kamala and Trump
You can directly inspect the data for these candidates to see if there are any issues:

r
Copy code
cleaned_poll_data |> 
  filter(`Candidate Favored` %in% c("Kamala", "Trump"))
This will show you if there’s any problem with their sample_size or data structure. If the names are consistent, and the sample_size is not NA, they should appear in the plot.

4. Ensure Consistent Naming (Optional)
If there are name inconsistencies, you can standardize the names like this:

r
Copy code
cleaned_poll_data <- cleaned_poll_data |> 
  mutate(`Candidate Favored` = case_when(
    `Candidate Favored` %in% c("Kamala", "Kamala Harris") ~ "Kamala Harris",
    `Candidate Favored` %in% c("Trump", "Donald Trump") ~ "Donald Trump",
    TRUE ~ `Candidate Favored`
  ))
This code will unify different variations of candidate names before proceeding with the aggregation and plotting.

Once you've addressed these issues, you can rerun the plot. Let me know if any of these checks surface the problem!
